# Weather Forecast Site

This project is a web application that allows users to search for the weather forecast of any location and toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius units. The app uses the [WeatherAPI](^1^) to fetch the weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The app also changes the look of the page based on the weather data, such as the background color and the images. Optionally, the app can also use the [Giphy API](^2^) to show relevant weather-related gifs.
